This is a course project of "Business Data Analysis and Mining", used 3 different ML models to predict the stock price of a chinese listed companeis, the models are not very complicated, mostly time-series predcitions.

There are markdowns/notes wirtten in Chinese explaining the modeling procedures and the output.

Any suggestion is welcome I'm still learning! XD
